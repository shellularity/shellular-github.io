so hello there, this was just something i made in a few hours in my free time after taking a basic course, i hope it was okay-
i'll probably add onto here about stuff i'm interested in but this code is definitely spaghetti incarnate
also, as you can tell by my edit "oops i mistyped it, i'm so good" i barely know how to use github so this'll be a learning experience for both of us okay
feel free to fork this page and steal the code n whatever just credit me kthxbye

oh yeah, she/her, if you wanna message me i'm @shellular on discord, that's really the only spot i'm terribly active-
